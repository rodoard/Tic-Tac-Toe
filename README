   Application where a human can play tictactoe against
   the computer. 
   
   Application is simply a default Rails 3 application 
   requiring Ruby version >= 1.9.2.
   
   No dependency on additional gems from that provided
   with Rails 3 installation with the exception on
   sqlite3 which is not used but some database 
   adapter is necessary to run the server.
   
   Application does not use Active Record
   or any database for that matter.
   
   Application boasts following features:
   
   --Unbeatable or Expert computer player
   
   --Detects for javascript and notifies user 
     if it is disabled
   
   --Continous play with score keeping 
   
   --Computer always plays second automagically
   
   --On game over no action takes place
     clicking on squares 
   
   --Clicking on a non blank square 
     results in an error message
   
   Some notes on design:
   
   Uses jquery and ajax
   
   State is passed around in url and some stored
   on the browser via javascript variables
   
   Board is viewed as a set of numbers from 1-9
   
   Whenever a player makes a move numbers are 
   removed from a set of available numbers
   
   Game is analyzed after each move for wins, ties
   
   A move is made on behalf of the computer when it 
   is the computer's turn
   
   Choice of move is first: 
       try to win
       block attempts by human to win
       pick randomly available cell
